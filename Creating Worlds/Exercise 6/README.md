# Materials

Create a collage of material references for the surfaces in your land. You can do this physically or virtually. It should contain images of every surface you can think of: roofs, floors, doors, interior/exterior walls and even small details such as door handles. Try to find at least 5 reference images for your collage.

Show this collage to a friend (or family member) and ask them what they can guess about your land from these materials (such as the time period, location and story).

* Did their ideas match your vision?
* If there were differences, what details might you change to better reflect your story?

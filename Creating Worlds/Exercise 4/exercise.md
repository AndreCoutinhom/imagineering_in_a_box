# Building design

Ferrallia takes place in a world in which beings have a great variety of convergent evolution features. This means that, as a concept, "everything is connected"; modern technology and nature. As we showcased on exercise 3, Ferralia would have 5 districts, one for a concentration for each evolution animal class, and they all concentrate into central core.

Similarly to what is thought on Elemental and Zootopia, architecture is planned to please the biggest concentration of being type for each district and concerning social values for animal classes. I gathered images that represent ideas for the extreme edges of each district and finally one for the central core.

### Prime Region

The name says it all, it's prime. I picture as the more wealthy part of Ferrallia, following the concept that primates are more sophisticated and smarter. This district would focus on high level design matching height and tree features for technology. I take inspiration on some of Singapore's architecture style. The futuristic garden is a great example of conceptual connectivity of modern technology and nature. It could be a great inspiration for the Prime Region interconnections:

### Invertebrate Docks

The Invertebrate Docks is represented in the concept as the concentration of beings that are considered less evoluted. Also, because they have no bones, they acquire less space and likely live in water. The interconnections for these areas could be inspired by Venice; lot of water and tight spaces between buildings. I asked chat GPT to picture Venice with some parts under the water, considering some beings would prefer to breathe underwater:

### Cool Town

The Cool Town clearly comes with a punch line. It represents beings with high traces of cold blooded animals; more adapted for hot and moisted environments. Also, the beings living in Cool Town would probably share deep connections to hot land and water. The first thing that came to my mind as an inspiration reference, was the beach of copacabana: extremely hot, with lots of water. However, I asked chat GPT to reimagine the city as having a river through the city, so that the district would include fresh water classes, as many cold blooded animals are:

### Warm Square

The Warm Square, populated by beings with high traces of warm blooded animal classes, would be only less wealthy than Prime Region. Since primates are also warm blooded and share strong functional relations to other warm blooded animals (as we see in real life with domestication), this area would regard the biggest concentration of worker beings, with a lot of labor. The variety of beings living there would be able to find comfort mostly through technological environment manipulation, and people would dream to find jobs there. I would picture as an 2020s american vibe of a place with a lot lucrative enterprises, like in the state of California or São Paulo city. To represent the idea I gathered two building references that would match Warm Square content vibes. The first one is the famous Apple park on Silicon Valley, and the other is the São Paulo's Business Center.

### Central Core

Finally, the Central Core is the place for every being. Is where every connection of convergent evolution takes an equal space. Since every form of life depends on water for their survival, the main concept of the Central Core must be water, the simplest representation of the origin of life itself. Water begins all, and all exists. One excellent reference for this concept is one the parks on the movie "Elemental" in which water is big at the center, and nature is spread in multiple forms:

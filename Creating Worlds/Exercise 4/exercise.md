# Building Design

First things first, I don't necessarily think this for the entire Ferrallia, but I believe that the futuristic city of Singapore represents a lot of what is expected as life representation in interconnection concept:

Second things second, one thing I think would be common for every district in Ferralia is a water connection; the simplest representation of life origins of all. So... floating houses:

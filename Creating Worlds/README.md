# Keep in mind

The differences for themed park storytelling from other forms:

* Use all of the senses;
* It is not a linear story;
* Guests can have a role in the story.

Theme determines what the story is about. Every decision made has to follow the meaning of the theme.

Types of graphics:

* Ghost Graphics - Part of the set design that puts the guests into the history ambience;
* Story Graphics - Features that directly tell guests about what's going on in the story (establishment names, posters);
* Operational Graphics - Directional signage (signs, entrance, direction pointers).

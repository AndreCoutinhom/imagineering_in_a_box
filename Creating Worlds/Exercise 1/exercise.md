# Question 1: What kind of land will you create?

I'd like to think about a world populated by multiple variations of hybrid animal beings. This would mean that there would be antropomorphic animals, human like creatures with some animal features or the original form for each animal (including humans). This is, of course, highly inspired by Zootopia, BNA and Spindle Horse studio style of characters. In this reality, evolution took a harsh step toward convergent features, so it was a less linear proceeding of evolution. Non-primate animals were also able to develop their intelligence into adquiring self consciousness and a sense of purpose. This led to a larger community of multiple species, showcasing a modern world idealized by multi-adaptable human hybrid beings. Some people have feathers to fly, others can breathe underwater, others have night vision, others can run really fast, and so on...

The name of this world is Ferrallia.

# Question 2: What is a story that takes place in this world?

Celebrating differences is not an evolutionary common sense. This world would feature prejudice and bully characters for those that doesn't share multiple habilities. In a world that most beings are hybrid animals, a simple human would be teased a lot and seen as "one that didn't evolved enough". So in this world there would be a story of a simple human being, living among hybrid animals that would all have something non-human about them. This character would eventually learn that although life is possible for him, it would be less thrilling when comparing to other beings that could fly, swim, run, or even communicate better than they.

People on this world should feel like they share similarities with a lot of different animals in their nature. Even though in our world those similarities are more subtle, the story of evolution teaches a lot what each species had to do in able to survive and thrive. I believe that it would thrilling to imagine one self posessing natural abilities that are, in our world, strinctly related to another animal species (we are constantly trying to do that through technology by the way).

# Your own land

Imagine you are asked to design and build a land of your own. You could create a place youâ€™ve dreamed of visiting (like a distant planet), a fictional place you imagined (like a cartoon land) or a story you want to bring to life (could be from your favorite movie or book).

**Question 1:** What kind of land will you create?

* You can come up with many ideas and pick your favorite later.
* What is the name of the land?

**Question 2:** What is a story that takes place in this world?

* What do you imagine happening in this world?
* How do you want this world to make people feel?

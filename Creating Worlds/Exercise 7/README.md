# Graphics & Color

Create a color pallete for your land. To do this choose 3-5 key colors which will be used throughout your land and reflect the theme and atmosphere you hope to create. You can do this physically (paint/pencils) or digitally.
For example, below is a five color pallete for Cars Land. Notice that the colors reflect the environment the story takes place in (such as sky blue, sandy rock and rusty cars).

Create one example of each kind of graphic which would appear for your own land: Ghost graphic, Story graphic, and Wayfinding.

* You can sketch these or use reference images (or a combination of both)
* You can do this physically or digitally

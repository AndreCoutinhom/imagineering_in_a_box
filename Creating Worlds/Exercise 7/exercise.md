# Graphics & Color

## Ghost graphic example

For the ghost graphic example I'm picturing the results of the life in Cool Town. We are talking about a hot and humid district, populated by amphibian and reptile feature holders. Similarly to beach areas (which came to be some of the inspirations for the district), there would traces of water and sand all over the streets. But since the town also regards beings that have to change skins and have sticky members, there would also be some white slashes and mucus through the places.

I asked chat GPT to picture Copacabana's sidewalk with traces of water, sand, slashes of reptile skin and transparent mucus. Seems a little gross, but it would be reality.

> Sidenote: Chat GPT took my prompt literaly as usual. We should try to ignore the fact that the space between the sidewalk and the sea are way to short.

## Story graphic example

So I chose to imagine a story graphic example for the Invertebrate Docks. This would be the most poor district, remaining the concept that it would be populated by invertebrate feature holders; commonly associated as the less evoluted. Every aspect of the Invertebrate Docks would work as a dicotomy of over water and under water, so moisture and flood would rule.

So people would be poor, and there would always be someone underwater. We can imagine that criminal and urban artistic activities would most likely happen in tight spaces underwater, where only boneless creatures could fit. 

For this exercise, I asked Chat GPT to picture a graffitied alley underwater. This would be a common area for octopus and squid related creatures, they would paint the walls with their own natural ink, respect their cephalopod original nature and despise primate's (holders of high society in this universe).

## Wayfinding/Operational graphic example

This example would be applied to a sign pointing to Warm Square. I imagine that the Warm Square would be culturally close to Prime Region because they share warm blood characteristics and sympathy that result in domestication in our world. Through this concept, we can imagine canines as being really popular.

The sign asked by Chat GPT is a resemblance of the way a dog would point with its nose. It would be a warm blooded animal association of a pointing direction. The resulted image likely represents a sign positioned in Invertebrate Docks, touched by moisture and decay.

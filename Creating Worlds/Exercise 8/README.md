# Sound design

To help bring your land to life you will need various layers of sound. In this activity you will need to find, create or describe at least three different sounds:

* soundscape (a constant background sound such as rain or ocean waves)
* music (a song which reflects your land)
* sound effects (randomly occurring sounds such as a lion roar or lighting strike)

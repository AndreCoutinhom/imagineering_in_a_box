# Sound design

## Soundscape

Throughout this lesson I am always picturing water to be a predominant element in Ferrallia. Even having areas that are more concentrated by it, the disposal of water chains troughout the city would cause humid winds.

The sound of a wind can indicate the direction of the sea. So a sound like the one portrayed on `soundscape.mp3` would maybe appear in many parts of Ferrallia, especially on Cool Town.

## Music

I thought a lot about this and I think it would be very interesting to think about a music style that combines more than one genre. If we look again to Ferrallia's map, we can see that each extreme district has some interconnections between the others, representing the links in convergent evolution. If we could think about a certain music genre that was popular in each area, then we would have combinations of these genres in the linked locations. George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, is a great example of combining classical and jazz music, one of the first cases of mixing different music genres. The game "Teamfight Tactics", from Riot Games, has showcased this concept in a larger and more modern way, by creating remixes of the same melody in several music genres and segments.

So let's think what music style would portray each district. 

### Invertebrate Docks

In the Invertebrate Docks, music would have strong beats, in a way that it could be felt even underwater. [Tiësto's Wave Rider](https://youtu.be/Y2SWE39OQdw) would be a perfect fit, especially concerning it's application as the kraken summoning in Hotel Transylvania 3.

### Warm Square

In Warm Square, where people would likely want to live, work and reach for their most ambitious goals, there should be a predominance of a power motivation and expression music; the kind that people listen in the gym and the artists are very expressive. I think that new Rock bands like Solence, would fit into the popular vibe of Warm Square, especifically [Animal In Me](https://youtu.be/hwy0636eYsA) would be a very popular song, reminding each being of their primal nature.

### Cool Town

Cool Town is more calm; most beings in there prefer to be slow and stand in the sun. I feel like a Bossa Nova style of music would likely fit into the beach ambience and untrheatning vibes that cold blooded animals are all for. [Rosa Passo's Lobo Bobo](https://youtu.be/tKnL5Uc-18Y) would be a very smart choice by creating a big contrast between the Warm Square vibes.

### Prime Region

Prime Region is all about high quality and expensiveness, the highest point of society. So music that plays there is exactly the one considered to be the highest of respect and technical value: Classical music. To portray this idea I picked [James Levine's conduction of the end credits of Fantasia 2000](https://youtu.be/VI0uhgOmMQU), a mashup of three of the greatest classical arrangements of all times: Camille Saint-Saëns' Carnival of the Animals; Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 and Edgar Elgar's Pomp & Circumstance. 

### Exercise

So finally, the song that I select to be held by this exercise, and is showcased on `music.mp3` is one that representes the intersection of Prime Region and Invertebrate Docks. Even a small intersection can have it's own distinct culture. Combining classical music with strong beat electrical music is something that has already been done several times by violinist Lindsay Stirling. The song Elements is the one showcased on the `music.mp3` file.

## Sound Effects

One example of a possible recurrent sound for Warm Square is one of large wings flapping. Warm Square would be filled with bird feature holders, so the sound effects portrayed by fictional giant birds, like the hippogriff in Harry Potter, would be very fitting for this district. On `sound_effect.mp3` there is a sample of how the flapping of beings would sound.

# Landscape

**Question:** What does the plant life tell you about the land and how does it make you feel?

**Activity:** Find one or more reference images for both the plant life and landscape of your land.

* How do these images reflect the theme and story of your land?
* If you’d like to create new plants, which don’t exist on earth, provide a sketch!

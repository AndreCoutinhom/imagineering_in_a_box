# Landscape

Is interesting, because convergent evolution should bring all sorts of plants also interconnecting, so there would be some non tropical plants on tropical areas. In the world of Ferrallia, there would be palm trees with spikes, carnivorous roses and cactuses with fruits. It would probably make people feel a bit weird, but curious about the properties that could come with plants.

I asked chat GPT to picture the beach of Copacabana as if there was a river connected to the sea. I also asked it to picture palm trees with spikes on their stem, so that we could visualize convergent evoluted plants on this area. This would probably belong to Cool Town (cool blooded animals are likely related to moisted and hot environments from both sea water and fresh water):

We can imagine that the story of this world portrays a higher complexity of life adaptation to survival. So the variety of beings capabilities and nature is so big, that it could be hard to find adaptation for all of them. But water is something that brings all together, every origin of life and vital for every form of it. The landscape and plants should be able to bring this. Ferrallia would be a place with no lack of plants or water. As a matter of fact, water and plants would be everywhere. The park on Elemental city (one of Wade and Ember's date) is a really good sort of inspiration:

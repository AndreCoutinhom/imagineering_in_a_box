# Question 1: Think of one of your favorite storiesâ€¦it could be from a book, movie, play, game or anything else.

I'm choosing the world of Zootopia, my very favorite animation movie. The story is really about the struggle of life, and how difficult it is to accomplish somethings. No matter how ambicious your goals are, you can always expect physical, emotional and social challenges along the way.

The main lesson is that even with struggles, the journey is worth it. The path you take to face those challenges can be a way to make the world a better place.

It made me reflect a lot. By the time I whatched it I was a teenager so I immediatly identified myself as a victim of society and took the message of prejudice. But later, as I started to work and seek for opportunities, I began to understand that those social struggles (mostly created by my perceptions of things, and not by how things really were) were just a part of all the challenges I had to face. I studied harder and thought better about the world around me. Zootopia made me smarter.

# Question 2: Return to the land you were imagining in the previous exercise.

In Ferrallia you will have all the opportunities to "feel different". It doesn't matter where you go, people will have evolutionary features that could be insanely different than yours. I think it would be the sensation of visiting another country or a super turistic city (New York for example), but instead of differentiating between people's faces or clothes, it would be their entire nature.

Ferralia is an extreme interpretation of what we do among humans and among other animals. When we are kids we may wonder and wish for animal features: "I wish I could fly like that bird", or "I wish I could swim like that sealion", or "I wish I was strong like that bull", or "I wish I could climb like that cat". On the other hand, when we are adults we might wonder and wish things regarding other humans, less of a nature change design, and more of a social status or privileges sometimes, but not always, achievable through effort: "I wish I was rich like Elon Musk", or "I wish I was beautiful like Gigi Hadid", or "I wish I was famous like Madonna", or "I wish I was creative like Tim Burton". Truth is, we all have features that may not feel like enough for us, but the world we live in is supposed to work for all of us, and all of us can enjoy it somehow.

It would be awesome if people could go home and feel more passionate about their own nature. Grateful for their lives, for the things they are able to do and respect their limitations. Most important of all, enjoy the big world they were gifted with.

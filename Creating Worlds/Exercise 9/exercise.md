# Design a Menu

The menu page showed in this exercise is themed with the visual intersection of elements, matching the story theme that everything in life can be connected and present harmony.

The content of the menu also follows this theme. I took base of some dishes, snacks and drinks created by Chef Cadu Alves, which experiments unusual combinations of flavors and foods that are not usually mixed up.

# Pitch

Well, I'm a Power Point dominator, so I would probably work with tons of animated and dynamic slides to present the ride's idea. I would also show a little bit of how DJ Franken and MC Shawk would be portrayed. For this I'd hold inspirations from Tiesto as a DJ figure and Finding Dory's giant squid as an animal figure inspiration. Then Tubarão MC as a rapper figure and Jeff the land shark in its venom form as an animal figure.

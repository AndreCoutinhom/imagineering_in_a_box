# Pitching

Pitch your storyboard to friends or family members. Here are some things to consider while preparing your pitch:

* What is the setup of your pitch?
* What’s unique about your attraction?
* What’s the climax?
* How will your pitch end?

Once you are finished pitching take some time to digest the feedback you’ve received. Then go back and adjust your storyboard to address the feedback. Continue this process until you are happy with your storyboard.

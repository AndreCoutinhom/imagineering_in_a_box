# Choose your ride system

## Is the vehicle on land or in water?

Mainly on the water.

## How many riders do you plan to put in each ride vehicle?

Based on what I know from some roller coasters with a high capacity, I'd say 32.

## Is the vehicle on a track or does it move freely?

It's on a track.

## Do the vehicle seats move or are they facing one direction?

Moves on one direction, as the seats of a train.

## How does this vehicle support the story of your attraction?

It's the most popular path from the Central Core to the Invertebrate Docks. The final station is where it holds the concert.

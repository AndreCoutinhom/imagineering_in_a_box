# Choose your ride system

What kind of ride system do you imagine will take people through your ride? Here are some key questions to answer:

**Questions:**

* Is the vehicle on land or in water?
* How many riders do you plan to put in each ride vehicle?
* Is the vehicle on a track or does it move freely?
* Do the vehicle seats move or are they facing one direction?
* How does this vehicle support the story of your attraction?


Provide a rough sketch of what your ride vehicles might look like.

Brainstorm with a partner or group as many ideas for your ride as possible (such as stories, scenes within stories or special effects within scenes). Don’t worry if you don’t know the whole ride at this point. The goal is to collect a bucket of pieces of ideas for what will become your ride.

Create a Brainstorming Board by writing each idea on a post it and arrange them on a board or wall so you can see all the ideas in one place, move them around, and add new ones.

Here are some tips from the video to keep in mind:

* No “good” or “bad” ideas
* Build on other ideas
* Don’t throw away ideas
* Relax and have fun!

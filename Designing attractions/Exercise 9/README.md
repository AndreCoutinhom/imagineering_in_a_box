# Scale model

Create a scale model of your attraction which can fit on a small table. Try to aim for a 50:1 scale, that means 1 meter in real life is represented as 2 cm (about 1 inch) in the model. Remember your goal isnâ€™t to make a beautiful model but to demonstrate how the elements of your attraction will be arranged in 3D space.

Tips:

* Use simple materials you can find at home (cardboard, styrofoam, paper)
* Start broad and layout everything first in 2D, then build things up in 3D
* Add the little details after you have a rough 3D shape for your model
* One way to identify scene locations is with small pieces of paper with drawings on them.
* Once you finish your model you can try doing a ride preview using a small camera (such as a phone)

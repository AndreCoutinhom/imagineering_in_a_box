# Paper layout

Create a paper layout of your attraction by drawing out the track and the location of each scene in your story. Use a blank page as the space (or footprint) of your attraction. Using a pencil draw in your track and your scene locations (number your scenes from start to finish). The width of your track should be at least as wide as your finger on the printed page.

**Here is an example:**

## Start

The ride starts on the train station. It is modern, technological and multidimensional.

## 1

The train starts through a tunnel outside of water and leads out of it.

## 2

The train goes out of tunnel leaving the big Central Core behind and revealing a beautiful mashup of sea water and beach (the connection of invertebrate docks and cool town).

## 3 

The train starts going into a glass tunnel and then goes down underwater, protected by the tunnel. The transparent glass reveals a organic rock tunnel.

## 4

The track turns outside of the tunnel revealing a beautiful view of a underwater civilization. In the middle of it, the train stops and it is announced that the train is broken. The giant kraken then comes up and starts harassing the glass tunnel causing small cracks to it. The train then comes back to function nearly leaving the kraken behind.

## 5

The kraken successfully breaks the glass tunnel and steals the train car holding on to it as it brings it to a darker section of the Invertebrate Docks. It then starts staring at the train car's windows and threat to tear the train car apart.

## 6

The kraken stops and stares up. A giant whale comes to rescue scaring the kraken away and sharing a gentle look to the train car's passengers. The whale then puts the train car back to the tracks through an emergency opening of the glass tunnel.

## 7

The train goes back to leading the passengers in a straight line and protected by the glass tunnel. The view outside showcases artistic paintings on the walls, some of them glowing. The track keeps on until it reaches a marvelous view of DJ Franken and MC Shawk's concert.

## End

When leaving the train, guests can still enjoy the show that portrays outside of the glass wall. They can also leave to the upside of the Invertebrate Docks through an elevator and enjoy the least dangerous part of this side of town.

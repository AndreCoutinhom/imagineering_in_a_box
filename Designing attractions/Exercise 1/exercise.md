# Thrill and story

The entire Disney parks experience was memorable for me, but I have to say that the very best was Animal Kingdom's Flight of Passage. It was so beautiful and thrilling at the same time (also it took more than two hours in the line, but totally worth it).

It's the first one that comes to my mind because it was unexpectedly good. We knew by the size of the line that it was good, but we never expected such an immersive adventure.

There was story on the line, there was story on the preparation, on the items being held, and of course, during the attraction execution.

I learned later that it was a giant simulator with a giant screen with 3D effect. I'm pretty sure that we were not moving so fast, but it looked like because of what was happening in the screen.

The entire thrill was because of Avatar's story. I had watched the movie before and got amazed by the Ikrans' scenes. Since the attraction was completely based on the act of flying, they were entirely connected to the story.

# High concept

Write two or three high concept ideas for your own attraction. An example of a high concept statement is: “go for a bike ride on the moon”. Once you’ve come up with a few ideas, try them out on a friend to see how they respond. Pick the one you are most excited about to carry through the rest of this lesson.

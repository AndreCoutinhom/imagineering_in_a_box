# Storyboards

Create a simple storyboard for your ride. To start, write up a scene by scene list of your ride using your favorite ideas from the brainstorm.

* First this happens…. (scene 1)
* Then this happens… (scene 2)
* Then this happens… (scene 3)
* Finally this happens… (scene 4)

Once you have a scene ordering you like you can make simple sketches of each scene and lay them out on a board. Keep in mind you will want to change this many times so don’t focus on making beautiful drawings.

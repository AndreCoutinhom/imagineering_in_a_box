# Who is your character?

Throughout the exercises in this lesson your job is to dream up and design an animatronic character for a land or attraction of your own design.

**Activity:** It’s important to get to know who your character is on the inside in order to better understand how they will look and act on the outside. Here are some brainstorming questions to get you started.

* What is your characters name?
* Where does your character live?
* Is your character from the past, present or future?
* What does your character want or need?
* What does your character fear or dislike?
* What does your character eat for breakfast, how do they eat it?

**Activity 2:** Create a very rough sketch of your character to get a sense of their shape and size. Feel free to use any materials to create this sketch whether it’s by hand or on the computer. Do this quickly and don’t worry about making it look beautiful.

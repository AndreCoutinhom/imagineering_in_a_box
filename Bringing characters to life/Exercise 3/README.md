# Character Sheet

A character design sheet shows several sketches of a dwarf character pulling a rope. The central drawing shows the character leaning back with both hands gripping the rope. Smaller sketches around the page show different body and head angles. Labels identify poses such as "Right Arm Forward", "Body Foreway", and "Head Turn". There are notes for facial movements and a box with dialogue and character details.

**Activity:** Using a blank page make a simple character sheet for your character. It should contain:

* A rough sketch of your character in one or more key poses
* Draw the key motions you want your character to perform (does the head need to turn? Do the eyes or mouth need to move?)
* Describe the Personality of your character in one or two sentences.
* Describe the Story behind the character in one or two sentences.

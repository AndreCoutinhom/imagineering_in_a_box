# Costumes

Before building your character in detail itâ€™s helpful to create a rough costume of what they will look like. Keep in mind you can use your whole body for this costume...

or just a part of your body such as your hand.

**Activity:** Imagine you need to go to a costume party as your character. What would you wear?

* Demonstrate how your character moves using a simple costume.
* Try to create different emotions using your costume (sad, happy, curious, scared...)
